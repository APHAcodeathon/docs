# Getting Started with Blue Button

Blue Button is the symbol for a patient's access to their own data. This is the ability to get records in a human-readable and machine-readable format; and to send them where they choose. This enables a consumer to do everything from printing a physical copy to sharing it with a third party application.

This guide is designed for:

- **Data Holders**: Learn how to structure a patient health record and how to transmit it to a patient's location of choosing.
- **Application Developers**: Learn how to build applications powered by Blue Button data. Learn how to parse a patient health record and to prepare your application to recieve data from data holders.
